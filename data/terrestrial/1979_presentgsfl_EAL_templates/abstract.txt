The flowering data consisted of counts of Eriophorum inflorescences in each of six permanent 2x2m plots (except at Pump 4, Galbraith, Kuparuk River, and Kuparuk Ridge, where there were 10 plots each). The counts included inflorescences that had been clipped by ptarmigan but were still recognizable by their elongated culms. Counts were made in late May or early June of each year, after all of the current year's flowering culms had begun elongation but before maturation of the inflorescences. In 1980-1982, we also counted tussocks on each plot. Most of the plots are undisturbed but some are treated plots (see treatment code). See (Shaver, et al, 1986)
